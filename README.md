This Python script retrieves, processes, and visualizes historical weather data using Open-Meteo API. Users can either enter a city name (resolved to coordinates) or manually input latitude and longitude to fetch weather data. The goal of this project was to practice various Python skills, including:

Working with APIs (requests, openmeteo_requests)

Data retrieval and caching (requests_cache, retry_requests)

Data processing and analysis (pandas, NumPy)

Data visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)

File handling and automation (os, unique file naming, local storage)
